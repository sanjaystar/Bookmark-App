Smart Bookmark App
Build and deploy a simple bookmark manager with the following requirements:
1. User can sign up and log in using Google (no email/password -Google OAuth only)
2. A logged-in user can add a bookmark (URL + title)
Bookmarks are private to each user (User A cannot see User B's bookmarks)
Bookmark list updates in real-time without page refresh (if you open two tabs and add a bookmark in one, it should appear in the other)
5. User can delete their own bookmarks
6. App must be deployed on Vercel with a working live URL
Tech stack: Next.js (App Router, not Pages Router), Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime), Tailwind CSS for basic styling
Submit:
• Live Vercel URL (we will test by logging in with our own Google account)
• GitHub repo (public)
• A README.md that includes: what problems you ran into and how you solved them
Time limit: 72 hours
You may use any tools, Al assistants, or documentation you want. We care about the final working product and your ability to explain what you built.
